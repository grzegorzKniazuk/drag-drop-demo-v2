It can be used in the following ways:\n *\n * - Specify the svgIcon input to load an SVG icon from a URL previously registered with the\n *   addSvgIcon, addSvgIconInNamespace, addSvgIconSet, or addSvgIconSetInNamespace methods of\n *   MatIconRegistry. If the svgIcon value contains a colon it is assumed to be in the format\n *   \"[namespace]:[name]\", if not the value will be the name of an icon in the default namespace.\n *   Examples:\n *     `<mat-icon svgIcon=\"left-arrow\"></mat-icon>\n *     <mat-icon svgIcon=\"animals:cat\"></mat-icon>`\n *\n * - Use a font ligature as an icon by putting the ligature text in the content of the `<mat-icon>`\n *   component. By default the Material icons font is used as described at\n *   http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web. You can specify an\n *   alternate font by setting the fontSet input to either the CSS class to apply to use the\n *   desired font, or to an alias previously registered with MatIconRegistry.registerFontClassAlias.\n *   Examples:\n *     `<mat-icon>home</mat-icon>\n *     <mat-icon fontSet=\"myfont\">sun</mat-icon>`\n *\n * - Specify a font glyph to be included via CSS rules by setting the fontSet input to specify the\n *   font, and the fontIcon input to specify the icon. Typically the fontIcon will specify a\n *   CSS class which causes the glyph to be displayed via a :before selector, as in\n *   https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/\n *   Example:\n *     `<mat-icon fontSet=\"fa\" fontIcon=\"alarm\"></mat-icon>`\n */\nvar MatIcon = /** @class */ (function (_super) {\n    __extends(MatIcon, _super);\n    function MatIcon(elementRef, _iconRegistry, ariaHidden, _location) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this, elementRef) || this;\n        _this._iconRegistry = _iconRegistry;\n        _this._location = _location;\n        _this._inline = false;\n        // If the user has not explicitly set aria-hidden, mark the icon as hidden, as this is\n        // the right thing to do for the majority of icon use-cases.\n        if (!ariaHidden) {\n            elementRef.nativeElement.setAttribute('aria-hidden', 'true');\n        }\n        return _this;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(MatIcon.prototype, \"inline\", {\n        /**\n         * Whether the icon should be inlined, automatically sizing the icon to match the font size of\n         * the element the icon is contained in.\n         */\n        get: /**\n         * Whether the icon should be inlined, automatically sizing the icon to match the font size of\n         * the element the icon is contained in.\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function () {\n            return this._inline;\n        },\n        set: /**\n         * @param {?} inline\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function (inline) {\n            this._inline = coerceBooleanProperty(inline);\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(MatIcon.prototype, \"fontSet\", {\n        /** Font set that the icon is a part of. */\n        get: /**\n         * Font set that the icon is a part of.\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function () { return this._fontSet; },\n        set: /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function (value) {\n            this._fontSet = this._cleanupFontValue(value);\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(MatIcon.prototype, \"fontIcon\", {\n        /** Name of an icon within a font set. */\n        get: /**\n         * Name of an icon within a font set.\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function () { return this._fontIcon; },\n        set: /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function (value) {\n            this._fontIcon = this._cleanupFontValue(value);\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * Splits an svgIcon binding value into its icon set and icon name components.\n     * Returns a 2-element array of [(icon set), (icon name)].\n     * The separator for the two fields is ':'.

The value accessor is used by the `FormControlDirective`, `FormControlName`, and\n * `NgModel` directives.\n *\n * @usageNotes\n *\n * ### Using select controls in a reactive form\n *\n * The following examples show how to use a select control in a reactive form.\n *\n * {@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * ### Using select controls in a template-driven form\n *\n * To use a select in a template-driven form, simply add an `ngModel` and a `name`\n * attribute to the main `<select>` tag.\n *\n * {@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * ### Customizing option selection\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to select option. It's possible for the identities of items\n * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced\n * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the\n * second response will produce objects with different identities.\n *\n * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select>` supports `compareWith` input.\n * `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.\n * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects option by the return value of the function.\n *\n * ```ts\n * const selectedCountriesControl = new FormControl();\n * ```\n *\n * ```\n * <select [compareWith]=\"compareFn\"  [formControl]=\"selectedCountriesControl\">\n *     <option *ngFor=\"let country of countries\" [ngValue]=\"country\">\n *         {{country.name}}\n *     </option>\n * </select>\n *\n * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {\n *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * **Note:** We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n *\n * @ngModule ReactiveFormsModule\n * @ngModule FormsModule\n * @publicApi\n */\nvar SelectControlValueAccessor = /** @class */ (function () {\n    function SelectControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        /** @internal */\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._idCounter = 0;\n        /**\n         * @description\n         * The registered callback function called when a change event occurs on the input element.\n         */\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\n        /**\n         * @description\n         * The registered callback function called when a blur event occurs on the input element.\n         */\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n        this._compareWith = ɵlooseIdentical;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype, \"compareWith\", {\n        /**\n         * @description\n         * Tracks the option comparison algorithm for tracking identities when\n         * checking for changes.\n         */\n        set: function (fn) {\n            if (typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                throw new Error(\"compareWith must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn));\n            }\n            this._compareWith = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * Sets the \"value\" property on the input element.

If used\n * within a parent form, the directive also registers itself with the form as a child\n * control.\n *\n * This directive is used by itself or as part of a larger form. Use the\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n *\n * It accepts a domain model as an optional `Input`. If you have a one-way binding\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n * class sets the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI always syncs back to\n * the domain model in your class.\n *\n * To inspect the properties of the associated `FormControl` (like validity state),\n * export the directive into a local template variable using `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`).\n * You then access the control using the directive's `control` property,\n * but most properties used (like `valid` and `dirty`) fall through to the control anyway for direct access.\n * See a full list of properties directly available in `AbstractControlDirective`.\n *\n * @see `RadioControlValueAccessor`\n * @see `SelectControlValueAccessor`\n *\n * @usageNotes\n *\n * ### Using ngModel on a standalone control\n *\n * The following examples show a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n *\n * {@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n *\n * In the context of a parent form, it's often unnecessary to include one-way or two-way binding,\n * as the parent form syncs the value for you. You access its properties by exporting it into a\n * local template variable using `ngForm` such as (`#f=\"ngForm\"`). Use the variable where\n * needed on form submission.\n *\n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\n *\n * ### Using ngModel within a form\n *\n * The following example shows controls using `ngModel` within a form:\n *\n * {@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * ### Using a standalone ngModel within a group\n *\n * The following example shows you how to use a standalone ngModel control\n * within a form.

The name attribute is used\n * within a custom form component, and the name `@Input` property serves a different purpose.\n *\n * ```html\n * <form>\n *   <my-person-control name=\"Nancy\" ngModel [ngModelOptions]=\"{name: 'user'}\">\n *   </my-person-control>\n * </form>\n * <!-- form value: {user: ''} -->\n * ```\n *\n * @ngModule FormsModule\n * @publicApi\n */\nvar NgModel = /** @class */ (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgModel, _super);\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this) || this;\n        _this.control = new FormControl();\n        /** @internal */\n        _this._registered = false;\n        /**\n         * @description\n         * Event emitter for producing the `ngModelChange` event after\n         * the view model updates.\n         */\n        _this.update = new EventEmitter();\n        _this._parent = parent;\n        _this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        _this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        _this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(_this, valueAccessors);\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * @description\n     * A lifecycle method called when the directive's inputs change.

First, developers have found this pattern\n * confusing. It seems like the actual `ngModel` directive is being used, but in fact it's\n * an input/output property named `ngModel` on the reactive form directive that simply\n * approximates (some of) its behavior. Specifically, it allows getting/setting the value\n * and intercepting value events. However, some of `ngModel`'s other features - like\n * delaying updates with`ngModelOptions` or exporting the directive - simply don't work,\n * which has understandably caused some confusion.\n *\n * In addition, this pattern mixes template-driven and reactive forms strategies, which\n * we generally don't recommend because it doesn't take advantage of the full benefits of\n * either strategy. Setting the value in the template violates the template-agnostic\n * principles behind reactive forms, whereas adding a `FormControl`/`FormGroup` layer in\n * the class removes the convenience of defining forms in the template.\n *\n * To update your code before v7, you'll want to decide whether to stick with reactive form\n * directives (and get/set values using reactive forms patterns) or switch over to\n * template-driven directives.\n *\n * After (choice 1 - use reactive forms):\n *\n * ```html\n * <input [formControl]=\"control\">\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * this.control.setValue('some value');\n * ```\n *\n * After (choice 2 - use template-driven forms):\n *\n * ```html\n * <input [(ngModel)]=\"value\">\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * this.value = 'some value';\n * ```\n *\n * By default, when you use this pattern, you will see a deprecation warning once in dev\n * mode. You can choose to silence this warning by providing a config for\n * `ReactiveFormsModule` at import time:\n *\n * ```ts\n * imports: [\n *   ReactiveFormsModule.withConfig({warnOnNgModelWithFormControl: 'never'});\n * ]\n * ```\n *\n * Alternatively, you can choose to surface a separate warning for each instance of this\n * pattern with a config value of `\"always\"`.

First, developers have found this pattern\n * confusing. It seems like the actual `ngModel` directive is being used, but in fact it's\n * an input/output property named `ngModel` on the reactive form directive that simply\n * approximates (some of) its behavior. Specifically, it allows getting/setting the value\n * and intercepting value events. However, some of `ngModel`'s other features - like\n * delaying updates with`ngModelOptions` or exporting the directive - simply don't work,\n * which has understandably caused some confusion.\n *\n * In addition, this pattern mixes template-driven and reactive forms strategies, which\n * we generally don't recommend because it doesn't take advantage of the full benefits of\n * either strategy. Setting the value in the template violates the template-agnostic\n * principles behind reactive forms, whereas adding a `FormControl`/`FormGroup` layer in\n * the class removes the convenience of defining forms in the template.\n *\n * To update your code before v7, you'll want to decide whether to stick with reactive form\n * directives (and get/set values using reactive forms patterns) or switch over to\n * template-driven directives.\n *\n * After (choice 1 - use reactive forms):\n *\n * ```html\n * <form [formGroup]=\"form\">\n *   <input formControlName=\"first\">\n * </form>\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * this.form.get('first').setValue('some value');\n * ```\n *\n * After (choice 2 - use template-driven forms):\n *\n * ```html\n * <input [(ngModel)]=\"value\">\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * this.value = 'some value';\n * ```\n *\n * By default, when you use this pattern, you will see a deprecation warning once in dev\n * mode. You can choose to silence this warning by providing a config for\n * `ReactiveFormsModule` at import time:\n *\n * ```ts\n * imports: [\n *   ReactiveFormsModule.withConfig({warnOnNgModelWithFormControl: 'never'});\n * ]\n * ```\n *\n * Alternatively, you can choose to surface a separate warning for each instance of this\n * pattern with a config value of `\"always\"`. This may help to track down where in the code\n * the pattern is being used as the code is being updated.\n *\n * @ngModule ReactiveFormsModule\n * @publicApi\n */\nvar FormControlName = /** @class */ (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormControlName, _super);\n    function FormControlName(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors, _ngModelWarningConfig) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this) || this;\n        _this._ngModelWarningConfig = _ngModelWarningConfig;\n        _this._added = false;\n        /** @deprecated as of v6 */\n        _this.update = new EventEmitter();\n        /**\n         * @description\n         * Instance property used to track whether an ngModel warning has been sent out for this\n         * particular FormControlName instance.
